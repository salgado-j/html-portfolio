              This project was my first Technical Team Project using Software Engineering Principles. We planned, designed, and launched a software product, which was an appointment scheduler for a tattoo shop.
              It was quite a learning experience because up to this point we had always "played the part" of just planning and not actually implementing our designs.
              This small project was a Tattoo Scheduler that allowed Tattoo artist to upload their work into a mobile application and users to view the work that is uploaded by the artist
              & schedule an appointment with the artist. Implemented multiple components to allow this application to function properly, such as a calendar to display available dates of each artist
              Scheduler class, so that the user can schedule an appointment with the artist profile classes, that both artist and user have a unique profile on the application.   
            </p>

              <p>Another challenge in this project that we overcame was the using JavaFX for our application, originally our team was going to use iOS since this was a mobile application, but we were confined within Java for this project,
                  so we used JavaFX to create a GUI (graphical user interface). We quickly understood that JavaFX presented another challenge which was transitioning to another page or a "Scene" in JavaFX.
                  HTML provides a more efficient transition to pages using tags like the <a href ="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a"> Anchor-Tag </a> and much easier documentation to find on transitioning to multiple pages. There were many lessons learned in this project and one important lesson is to choose the most appropriate
                  programming language for your projects design & functionality to ensure that the programming language is efficient to produce a high quality software product.
